Remember we are essentially copying a previous Cohort's structure. I'm adding everyone as a contributor.

If you want to contribute Make an issue and assign yourself to it, check to make sure someone is not already working on that feature.

Also if you want to swap from jQuery to Angular im down like a clown, charlie brown. But tbh lazy. Come talk to me if you do.
