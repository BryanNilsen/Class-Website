While working at Bridge Education Group in Denver, I had the opportunity to work with an amazing graphic design and web development team. I was amazed at what they were able to create (both in beautiful design and impressive functionality). If I asked them to move a button, they could! It was magic and I wanted to learn more about what they did each day.  To try my hand at coding, I attended Nashville Software School's 3 week Jumpstart evening course - it was this course that helped me realize that not only could I learn software development, but I enjoyed it, as well! I am currently attending Nashville Software School's 6 month day program to learn both client side and server side development. I graduate at the end of March and am excited to see where this new career path takes me as I continually learn more about software development.</p>",

I love helping others and get excited when it involves learning something new. Technology has always fascinated me since receiving my first computer as a young child. Always curious how things worked, I would endlessly tinker, experiment and read about computers, electric bass gear, or music recording equipment. I built my first website as a college freshman and was immediately enamored with the power and possibilities. Almost every job I’ve held has been related to technology. As I pondered the next steps in my career, the Nashville Software School became the obvious choice since it mirrored my drive to dive deep into learning new things. I’ve loved the collaborative environment and being challenged every day.</p><p>The music recording industry drew me to Nashville and was my livelihood for over 15 years. Working my way up from studio intern to staff engineer and eventually freelance audio engineer instilled a great work ethic, perseverance, and attention to detail. Working with countless production teams allowed me to hone my teamwork skills and learn to adapt to different environments and meet challenging deadlines. Being a part of the industry while it began embracing computers and digital storage further ingrained my deep love of technology and lifelong learning. There is always something new to learn. The amount of crossover between the recording industry and software development is amazing, from breaking down projects into small achievable blocks, to communicating well on a team, and thinking outside the box to solve problems.</p><p>When I’m not coding I love to mountain bike, discover new craft beer, tinker with Android development and spend time with my family.</p>",

I helped build the company's webstore in my free time at night while running the café by day utilizing user friendly technologies Squarespace and Shopify. That role ignited my interest in software development to learn and understand how these tools work under the hood and whether I could build some new tools myself. After some time self-studying through various online resources, I heard about Nashville Software School which offered a condensed, bootcamp-style software education teaching the primary skills in full-stack development, SCRUM methodology and the importance of continuous education. I attended a few info sessions to learn more about the school, signed up for a month long introduction to web development Jumpstart class, and quickly became hooked. I joined Evening Cohort E6 for front-end in June of 2017 and Day Cohort 22 in January of 2018 for back-end.

By August of 2015, I was out of the Army, enrolled in school as a Computer Programming student, and I remember vividly the elation and feeling of success I experienced after solving my first coding problem in my Intro to Object-Oriented Programming class. At that moment, I knew I had found my calling. When I'm not in school or sharpening my coding skills, you will find me spending time with family and friends, reading, listening to podcasts, enjoying live-music downtown, cheering on the Predators, Vols, and Titans, or dusting the camera off to shoot photos.</p>",
