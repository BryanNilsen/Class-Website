I was amazed at what they were able to create (both in beautiful design and impressive functionality). If I asked them to move a button, they could! It was magic and I wanted to learn more about what they did each day.</p><p>To try my hand at coding, I attended Nashville Software School's 3 week Jumpstart evening course - it was this course that helped me realize that not only could I learn software development, but I enjoyed it, as well! I am currently attending Nashville Software School's 6 month day program to learn both client side and server side development. I graduate at the end of March and am excited to see where this new career path takes me as I continually learn more about software development.</p>",

By August of 2015, I was out of the Army, enrolled in school as a Computer Programming student, and I remember vividly the elation and feeling of success I experienced after solving my first coding problem in my Intro to Object-Oriented Programming class. At that moment, I knew I had found my calling. When I'm not in school or sharpening my coding skills, you will find me spending time with family and friends, reading, listening to podcasts, enjoying live-music downtown, cheering on the Predators, Vols, and Titans, or dusting the camera off to shoot photos.</p>",

However I found myself answering my passion to pursue music and moved to Nashville to do so. Suprisingly I found work repairing and building guitars instead of managing water quality, and fell in love with process of building and repairing things for my clients. As I grew older, I found my desire for higher education struck again decided pursuing one of my other passions, technology, would be a great choice. Coming from the craft of guitar building, maitenence, and repair, learning to do the same for software came naturally to me. I enjoyed the intellectual challange software design presented to me and even more so I enjoyed the endless learning oppurtunites presented by the field. I find a great satisfaction in building a well crafted product, and have found a deep appreciation for the attention to detail and constant refinement of ideas necessitated by software design.</p><p> Some of the techs in which I have become advanced: JavaScript, AngularJS, CSS Grid/SASS C#, ASP.NET CORE 2.0, .NET MVC, SQL, NGINX, NPM, and Firebase.</p>",
